# Day 11 â€“ HTML5 Custom Video Player ðŸŽ¬

This is Day 11 of my JavaScript30 journey, featuring the HTML5 custom video player project.

### âœ… What I Learned:
- How to create and style a custom HTML5 video player from scratch
- How to use `.play()` and `.pause()` to control video playback
- How to use `range` input sliders to:
  - Control **volume**
  - Adjust **playback speed**
- How to add **skip buttons** (e.g. skip forward 25s or back 10s)
- How to update the **progress bar** in real-time and make it interactive (scrubbing)
- How to add a **fullscreen toggle button** using the `requestFullscreen()` API
- How to use **Material Symbols** to display fullscreen icons (not in the original Wes Bos project)

This was a really practical project and helped me understand how real video players are built under the hood.
