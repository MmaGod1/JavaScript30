# Day 3: What I Learned

Today's project introduced me to something I'd never considered - working with CSS variables from JavaScript. It's pretty cool how you can dynamically update styles this way.

This was also my first time using input types like `range` and `color`. it's a good exposure to these elements and how they can make interfaces more interactive.
