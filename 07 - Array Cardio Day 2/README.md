# 💪 Day 7 – Array Cardio Practice

I really enjoyed working on this challenge because it introduced me to some new and powerful array methods in JavaScript.

Today’s focus was all about practicing array methods like:

- `every()` to check if all items pass a condition
- `find()` to get a specific item from an array
- `findIndex()` to locate an item’s position in an array
- `some()` to check if at least one item meets a condition

Although I already knew a bit about `findIndex`, it was still great to revisit it in this “cardio” style exercise — just like the theme suggested, it felt like a good workout for my logic!
