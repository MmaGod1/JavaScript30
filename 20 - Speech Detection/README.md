## ðŸ“† Day 20 â€“ Speech Recognition

This was my first time working with **speech recognition in the browser**, and it was really intuitive. I learned how to use the Web Speech API to listen to voice input and show the transcribed text on the screen in real time.

It was hands-on and easy to follow. I also learned how to:

* Set up `SpeechRecognition` properly
* Keep it listening continuously using the `end` event
* Serve the project with a local server (BrowserSync) to get microphone access

Overall, it was a nice intro to working with voice in JavaScript.
