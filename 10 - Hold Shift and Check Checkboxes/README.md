# 10 - Hold Shift and Check Checkboxes âœ…

This project is part of the **JavaScript 30 Challenge** and demonstrates how to work with checkboxes using JavaScript, including adding functionality to select multiple checkboxes by holding down the **Shift** key.

## ðŸš€ What I Learned

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in:

- Working with `<input type="checkbox">` elements in the DOM.
- Listening for `click` events on checkboxes.
- Detecting when the **Shift** key is pressed using `event.shiftKey`.
- Implementing logic to toggle the `checked` state of a group of checkboxes based on user interaction.
- Using flags and conditionals to control program flow.

Although the logic was initially a bit tricky to understand, especially figuring out how to track the "first checked" box and apply the shift-select logic, I eventually got the hang of it â€” and Iâ€™m proud of that!
