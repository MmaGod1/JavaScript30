# Day 22 â€“ Follow Along Link Highlighter

Today, I learned how to make **link highlights interactive** using JavaScript and CSS. It's really fun, dynamic, and very useful when designing a clean and engaging web layout.

### What I Learned
- How to detect the size and position of a link using `getBoundingClientRect()`
- How to use `transform: translate()` for smooth positioning
- How to dynamically update the highlight element to follow links on hover
- How to make a shared highlight element apply to any hovered link (instead of duplicating elements)

### Why It's Useful
This technique adds subtle but powerful **interactivity** to websites. It helps guide user attention, improves navigation feel, and just makes your UI look and feel more polished.
