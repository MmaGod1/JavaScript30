# 🖌️ Day 8 – HTML5 Canvas

Today’s challenge introduced me to the HTML5 `<canvas>` element for the first time. It looks really interesting, but also a bit overwhelming right now — especially since it involves a different way of drawing and interacting with the screen using JavaScript.

Since I’ve never worked with canvas before, I’ve decided to **pause Day 8** for now and come back to it later when I have more time to explore it properly.

Before diving deeper, I plan to:
- Watch a few videos to understand how canvas works
- Read through some documentation and beginner tutorials
- Try some small canvas experiments on my own
