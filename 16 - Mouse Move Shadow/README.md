# Day 16 - Mouse Move Shadow

Took a while for the maths to sink in. So, here's a description for any one who cares.

This project applies a colorful, multi-directional text shadow to a heading (`<h1>`) based on the user's mouse position inside a container (`.hero`). It uses DOM events and basic geometry to create an interactive visual effect.

This README explains **why the code works**, not just how ‚Äî including two critical pieces of logic:

---

## üìç Part 1: Mouse Position Correction (offsetX/offsetY)

### ‚ùì What's the Problem?

When you listen for `mousemove` on a container like `.hero`, the event can also trigger when the mouse is over a child element, like `<h1>`.

In that case, `e.offsetX` and `e.offsetY` will be **relative to the child element**, not to `.hero`. This breaks our shadow effect, which relies on knowing the cursor's position **inside `.hero` only**.

### üí° The Fix

To correct this, we **manually add the child element‚Äôs offset** from `.hero`:

```js
if (this !== e.target) {
  x += e.target.offsetLeft;
  y += e.target.offsetTop;
}
````

### üìê Conceptual Formula

```txt
mouse's position relative to .hero =
mouse's position relative to h1 +
h1‚Äôs position relative to .hero
```

This ensures that no matter where the mouse is ‚Äî on `.hero` directly or on its children ‚Äî the shadow is always calculated **relative to `.hero`**.

## üé® Part 2: The Shadow Movement Formula

```js
const xWalk = Math.round((x / width * maxDistance) - (maxDistance / 2));
const yWalk = Math.round((y / height * maxDistance) - (maxDistance / 2));
```

This determines **how far** the shadow moves in the X and Y directions.

### üîç Formula Breakdown

| Part                  | What It Does                           | Why It's Needed                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `x / width`           | Normalize mouse position into 0 ‚Üí 1    | So it works no matter the screen size      |
| `* maxDistance`       | Stretch the 0‚Äì1 value to 0‚ÄìmaxDistance | To control how far the shadow can move     |
| `- (maxDistance / 2)` | Recenter the value around 0            | So center = no shadow, edges = full shadow |
| `Math.round(...)`     | Remove decimals                        | Clean, crisp shadows (avoid blurry pixels) |

---

### üß† Why Subtract `maxDistance / 2`?

Without this, the shadow offset would go from `0 ‚Üí maxDistance`, and you'd never get zero movement in the middle. We want it centered:

```txt
Left of container  ‚Üí -maxDistance / 2
Middle of container ‚Üí 0
Right of container ‚Üí +maxDistance / 2
```

So we subtract `maxDistance / 2` to **center the range around zero**.

This is a general pattern in UI math called:

### üéØ Centering a Range Around Zero

Whenever you're turning user input (mouse, scroll, etc.) into movement or rotation ‚Äî and you want the center of the element to mean "no effect" ‚Äî subtract half of the total effect range.

```js
let value = ((position / max) * range) - (range / 2);
```


## ‚úÖ Summary

This project uses two smart adjustments:

1. **Offset Correction**:
   `offsetX/Y` gives wrong values on child elements, so we add `offsetLeft/Top` to compensate.

2. **Shadow Centering**:
   Shadow values are centered by subtracting `maxDistance / 2`, allowing smooth symmetrical animation from the center.
