# Day 21 - Geolocation>
This mini project helped me learn how to use the **Navigator API** and the **Geolocation API** in JavaScript.

## What I Learned

- How to access the user's location using `navigator.geolocation`.
- The difference between `getCurrentPosition()` and `watchPosition()`.
- How to handle success and error callbacks.
- How to simulate geolocation in the browser (like in Chrome/Edge DevTools).
- How to serve the project using a local server and access it from my phone using IP address.
