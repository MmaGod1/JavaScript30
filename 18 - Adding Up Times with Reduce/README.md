# 18 - Tally String Times with Reduce

I had a lot of fun doing this one! It was really easy and satisfying to work through.

Here's what I learned:

- How to select all video elements using a `data-time` attribute
- How to split a time string like `5:43` into minutes and seconds
- How to convert those into total seconds
- How to use `.reduce()` to sum all the video durations
- How to convert the total seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds
- How to format the result nicely for display

Great little exercise with array methods and time formatting!
