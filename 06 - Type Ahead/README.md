# Type Ahead Search Project

This project was a bit challenging for me, but I was able to scale through it. It’s the first time I’m using the **Fetch API**, and I learned how to fetch external data and use it dynamically in a project.

One of the most interesting parts was using the **input box as a live search field**, instead of just using it to fill a form. Watching it filter results from the JSON data in real-time was exciting, even though it took me some effort to get it right.

A major part that I found a bit complicated was working with **regular expressions** (`RegExp`). I've encountered them before, but they still don't come naturally to me. However, I believe that with more practice and projects like this, I’ll eventually get the hang of it.

Overall, I’m proud of the progress I made through this project. It taught me how to:
- Fetch and handle JSON data
- Filter data using input from a user
- Use regular expressions to match search terms
- Dynamically update the DOM based on search results

I like the CSS styling too, the paper folds perspective.
