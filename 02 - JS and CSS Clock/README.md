# Day 1: What I Learned

Today I tackled a clock project and finally dove into CSS transforms and transitions - stuff I've been avoiding because it seemed complicated.
Turns out it wasn't as scary as I thought.

What really got me excited was thinking about how clocks actually work. I never really considered the mechanics behind it before, but building one made me dig into the calculations that go into positioning the hands and making them rotate properly.
