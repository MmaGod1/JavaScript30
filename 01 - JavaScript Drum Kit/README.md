Day 1: What I Learned

Today, I started my 30-day challenge by building a small project using the <audio> tag for the first time. I learned how to use the HTML5 audio element to play sounds and how to work with custom data- attributes to link keys with sounds. I also explored how to detect and respond to keyboard events using key codes, and got introduced to the <kbd> tag for representing keyboard keys semantically. Adding sound effects and CSS transitions to key presses made the project interactive and really fun to build.
