Day 1: What I Learned

Today I built my first project using the HTML5 <audio> element. I learned how to play sounds and use custom data- attributes to link keys with their audio files.
I figured out keyboard event detection with key codes and discovered the <kbd> tag for showing keyboard keys. Adding sound effects and CSS transitions to the key presses made it interactive and fun to build.
Good start to the 30-day challenge.
