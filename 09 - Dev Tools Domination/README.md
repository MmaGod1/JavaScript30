# 09 - Dev Tools Domination 🛠️

This is Project 9 of the **JavaScript 30 Challenge**, and it focuses on using powerful features of the browser’s **Developer Tools** — especially various `console` methods — to debug, inspect, and style outputs in the console like a pro.

## 🚀 What I Learned

Working on this project helped me discover and understand many useful `console` methods that I didn’t know about before. For example:

- `console.log()` – the default method I usually use.
- `console.warn()` – shows a warning with a yellow triangle.
- `console.error()` – displays errors with a red icon.
- `console.info()` – provides extra information.
- `console.table()` – formats arrays or objects as a table.
- `console.time()` and `console.timeEnd()` – helps measure how long code takes to run.
- `console.group()` and `console.groupEnd()` – creates collapsible logs for better readability.
- Styling logs with `%c` – to apply CSS styles directly inside `console.log()` output.

I used to wonder why I’d always write `console` and not automatically see `.log` – now I know it’s because there are many **other specialized methods** built into the `console` object!
